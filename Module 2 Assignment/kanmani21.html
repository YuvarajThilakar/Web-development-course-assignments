            <h1>static</h1>
            <p> HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according
                to the normal flow of the page</p>
            <h1>absolute</h1>
            <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the
                document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
            <h1>relative</h1>
            <P>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content
                will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</P>
