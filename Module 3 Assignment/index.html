                        Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent,
                        as well as among its diaspora. It is said that Mumtaz once visited the army barracks and found the Mughal soldiers looking weak and undernourished. She asked the chef to prepare a special dish that combined meat and rice to provide
                        balanced nutrition to the soldiers – and the result was biryani of course! At the time, rice was fried in ghee, without washing, to give it a nutty flavour and prevent it from clumping. Meat, aromatic spices, and saffron were added
                        to it before cooking the mix over a wood fire. The Nizams of Hyderabad and Nawabs of Lucknow were also famous for their appreciation of the subtle nuances of biryani. Their chefs were renowned the world over for their signature
                        dishes. These rulers too were responsible for popularising their versions of the biryani – and mouth watering accompaniments like mirchi ka salan, dhanshak and baghare baingan – in different parts of the country. The perfect biryani
                        calls for meticulously measured ingredients and a practised technique. Traditionally , the dum pukht method (slow breathing oven in Persian) was used to make biryani. In this method, the ingredients are loaded in a pot and slow
                        cooked over charcoal, sometimes from the top also, to allow the dum or steam to works its magic. The pot, sealed around the edges with dough, allows the steaming meat to tenderise in its own juices while flavouring the rice. Other
                        than the technique, spices also play a critical role in dishing out a good biryani – some recipes call for a very limited use of spices while others use more than 15 different spices. Meat or chicken is often the main ingredient,
                        though in some coastal varieties, fish, prawns, and crabs are also used. Use of rose water, sweet edible ittar and kewra water in biryani is also common, a practice prevalent since the medieval era.<a href="#navigation-bar"

                        Mutton Dum Biryani is an extremely delicious dish with a subtle taste where raw mutton is cooked together with half cooked rice and some authentic spices. Today, throughout India, one can see umpteen recipes of biryanis. In some cases, the biryani is
                        almost localised with the use of the particular traditional spices. Mutton biryani can be prepared by cooking the mutton and rice separately too, and then putting them on dum. But the authentic recipe calls for marination of mutton
                        either overnight in lots of curds or then for a few hours in a combination of curds and raw papaya paste which acts as a tenderiser. Biryani prepared with this method is extremely delicious and subtle in taste unlike some over
                        spiced biryanis which are served in some restaurants nowadays! For this again it is advisable to buy a good quality mutton leg piece or any other soft piece which results in soft and well cooked pieces in the biryani. I have always
                        loved the typical Muslim style biryani, just like this Hyderabadi Mutton Dum Biryani as they are very easy on the palate and are extremely satisfying. I have always loved traditional foods, then be they from any state or country!
                        Many years back, I had been watching a television show, where an old Muslim gentleman cooked biryani in this manner. I had always wanted to cook a similar one. Almost about 20 years back when I had almost no knowledge of cooking,
                        I had tried my hand at this very biryani and had been anxious till the time it was done. For all these years, except this one I had experimented with many more methods!<a href="#navigation-bar" class="link-to-menu d-md-none"> (Go to menu.)</a>

                        A hamburger (also burger for short) is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked[1] or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served
                        with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called
                        a cheeseburger.[2] The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger
                        usually implies beef, for clarity "burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or veggie burger. Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and
                        specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.
